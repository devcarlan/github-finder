# GitHub Finder

Easily search for GitHub user profiles.

## About

This project was created as a part of [Brad Travery's](https://github.com/bradtraversy) React Front 2 Back Course. Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and `Tailwind CSS` as well as `Daisy UI` for styling.

## Goal

The goal of this app is to interface with the GitHub API and allow a user to search for a GitHub user's profile. This was accomplished using `axios` to get data from the API and through the use of react hooks like `{ useState, useContext, useReducer }`.
